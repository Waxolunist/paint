# Paint for Kids

Paint for Kids is a free paint app, with no ads and no tracking code. No cookies or whatsoever are used to track you or the usage of the app. No data about users or devices are collected. I only count the number of downloads. It can be installed on most devices, by just adding it to the home screen. The app works offline.

Main goal of this app is having fun with painting. Even little kids should have no problems using it and parents should not have any privacy concerns letting them. 

Use a touch screen compatible pen for the best user experience.

If you have any issues with the app or want to see new features, just create an github issue please.
